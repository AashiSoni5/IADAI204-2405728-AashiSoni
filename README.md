Project Overview

This project analyses how Amazon customer reviews influence consumer trust, brand perception, and potential purchasing behaviour. Using a dataset of over 568,000 product reviews, the objective was to transform raw numerical and textual data into actionable business insights through interactive Tableau visualisations. The dashboard is designed for e-commerce managers, marketing teams, and brand strategists who require data-driven decision support rather than raw reporting.


Data Summary

The dataset contains Amazon product reviews with the following attributes:
Star Ratings (1–5)
Review Text
Helpfulness Votes (Numerator and Denominator)
Product ID
User ID
Timestamp of Review


Data Preparation Steps:

Removed missing and inconsistent rating entries

Converted timestamp into readable date format

Created a Helpfulness Ratio using:

HelpfulnessNumerator / HelpfulnessDenominator


Categorised reviews into Sentiment Groups:

4–5 stars → Positive

3 stars → Neutral

1–2 stars → Negative

Structured fields appropriately for Tableau analysis


exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis focused on identifying patterns between review quality, sentiment, and perceived trustworthiness. The following explorations were conducted:

Distribution of star ratings (1–5)
Sentiment breakdown (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
Comparison of average helpfulness ratio across star ratings
Trend analysis of average ratings over time
Keyword frequency patterns in positive and negative reviews


Business Recommendations

Monitor recurring negative keywords to identify operational gaps.
Promote highly helpful positive reviews to increase consumer trust.
Track rating trends regularly to assess brand perception shifts.
Improve logistics and service quality to reduce 1–2 star reviews.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates how structured data storytelling can transform large volumes of customer feedback into strategic business insights. By leveraging Tableau’s interactive capabilities, the analysis bridges the gap between raw review data and actionable managerial decisions.
